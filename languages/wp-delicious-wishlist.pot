"This plugin allows you to publish in your blog a wishlist using your "
"Delicious bookmarks. In order to make this, when you visit a web page with "
"something you like, tag that page with two different bookmarks: "
"<code>wishlist</code> and, if it is very important, <code>***</code> (three "
"stars). Then, when you visit a page with something less important, you could "
"use <code>wishlist</code> and <code>**</code> (two stars), and finally for a "
"page with something even less important, you could use <code>wishlist</code> "
"and <code>*</code> (one star). It's not mandatory to use these exact tags: "
"you can choose your own tags, but consider that you have to bookmark a page "
"with at least two different tags: one general to collect all your bookmarks "
"relative to your wishlist, and another to mark that page depending on the "
"importance of the stuff for you.<br /><br /> When you are done with an item "
"(you have bought it or someone gave it to you as a gift), you can edit that "
"bookmark on Delicious and remove the star(s), leaving only the main tag (e."
"g., <code>wishlist</code>), so you can maintain in Delicious an archive of "
"all desired items.<br /><br /> To start, fill in the fields in the form "
