In order to make this, when you visit a web page with something you like, tag that page with two different bookmarks: <code>wishlist</code> and, if it is very important, <code>***</code> (three stars). Then, when you visit a page with something less important, you could use <code>wishlist</code> and <code>**</code> (two stars), and finally for a page with something even less important, you could use <code>wishlist</code> and <code>*</code> (one star). It's not mandatory to use these exact tags: you can choose your own tags, but consider that you have to bookmark a page with at least two different tags: one general to collect all your bookmarks relative to your wishlist, and another to mark that page depending on the importance of the stuff for you.<br /><br />When you are done with an item (you have bought it or someone gave it to you as a gift), you can edit that bookmark on Delicious and remove the star(s), leaving only the main tag (e.g., <code>wishlist</code>), so you can maintain in Delicious an archive of all desired items.<br /><br />To start, fill in the fields in the form above."
